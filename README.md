# PulseGuard — Real-Time Transaction Monitoring & Fraud Detection Pipeline

Synthetic UPI, card, and NEFT transactions stream through Kafka, get scored
for fraud in real time by a hybrid rules + anomaly-model detection layer,
and surface to an analyst console with per-alert explainability. Analyst
decisions feed back into a label store for retraining, and a nightly batch
layer tracks fraud rate, per-rule precision, and feature drift.

The engineering emphasis is on streaming semantics that matter in a real
transaction-monitoring system: partition-by-customer for ordered stateful
processing, watermarked late-event handling, exactly-once delivery via
checkpointed offsets and idempotent sinks, and a single feature store shared
between training and serving so the two never drift apart.

## Status

This project is being built incrementally, in phases. Checked items are
implemented and tested; unchecked items are planned.

- [x] **Phase 1 — Generator & ingestion infra.** Behavioural customer
      population (5 archetypes), 6 labelled fraud patterns, a Kafka
      producer capable of both a realistically-paced historical stream and
      a rate-controlled load-test firehose, and the Kafka/Redis/Postgres
      Docker Compose stack with topics provisioned.
- [x] **Phase 2 — Streaming feature computation.** Spark Structured
      Streaming job computing 26 rolling behavioural features per customer
      via a stateful per-key operator, a watermarked sliding-window
      aggregation demo, dead-letter routing for malformed records, and a
      Redis online feature store — verified end-to-end against live Kafka.
- [ ] **Phase 3 — Detection layer.** Versioned velocity-rule engine plus an
      Isolation Forest anomaly model benchmarked against a supervised
      LightGBM model, with an alert threshold calibrated to analyst review
      capacity.
- [ ] **Phase 4 — Serving & analytical layer.** NestJS alert service,
      Next.js analyst console with live feed / drill-down / disposition
      capture, and a bronze/silver/gold Delta Lake layer with nightly PSI
      drift and per-rule precision jobs.
- [ ] **Phase 5 — Load testing & failure drills.** Throughput and latency
      numbers under load, plus documented recovery from executor kills,
      Redis outages, and malformed records.

## Why each piece matters

| Component | Why a bank cares |
|---|---|
| Partition by customer ID | All of a customer's events land in order on one partition. Stateful aggregation is meaningless otherwise. |
| Watermarking | Mobile transactions arrive late constantly. Dropping them silently corrupts velocity features. |
| Exactly-once semantics | Double-counting a transaction in a fraud aggregate creates false alerts; missing one creates false negatives. |
| Shared online feature store | Training/serving skew is the most common reason production fraud models underperform their offline metrics. |
| Rules alongside the model | Rules give zero-latency, fully explainable coverage of known patterns and keep working when the model is retraining. |
| Threshold tuned to analyst capacity | Alert volume is bounded by how many cases a human team can review. F1-optimal is operationally useless if it produces 4,000 alerts a day. |
| Analyst disposition capture | The only source of ground-truth labels in real fraud operations. Without it, the model never improves. |
| PSI drift monitoring | Fraud patterns shift weekly. A model with no drift monitor is a model nobody trusts. |

## Getting started

**1. Bring up the infra stack:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts Kafka (KRaft mode, no ZooKeeper) on `localhost:9092`, creates
the topics below, starts Kafka UI at `http://localhost:8080`, Redis at
`localhost:6380`, and Postgres at `localhost:5434` (non-default Redis/Postgres
ports so this stack doesn't collide with other local projects — adjust in
`docker-compose.yml` if you don't need to avoid a clash), and builds/starts
the Spark feature job. First run needs internet access: `spark-submit`
resolves the Kafka connector jars from Maven Central on startup and caches
them in the `spark_ivy_cache` volume, so subsequent restarts are fast.

| Topic | Partitions | Retention | Key |
|---|---|---|---|
| `raw.transactions` | 6 | 7 days | `customerId` |
| `fraud.alerts` | 3 | 30 days | `alertId` |
| `dead.letter` | 1 | 30 days | — |
| `analyst.dispositions` | 1 | forever (compacted) | `alertId` |

**2. Install the generator:**

```bash
cd generator
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Generate a labelled historical dataset** (behaviourally paced, useful
for feature engineering and model training):

```bash
python -m pulseguard_generator simulate \
  --customers 5000 --days 30 --sink kafka --topic raw.transactions
```

Or without Kafka running, to a file:

```bash
python -m pulseguard_generator simulate --customers 500 --days 3 --sink jsonl --out sample.jsonl
```

**4. Load-test the pipeline** (rate-controlled firehose, for Phase 5):

```bash
python -m pulseguard_generator loadtest \
  --customers 5000 --sink kafka --topic raw.transactions --rate 3000 --duration 120
```

The command prints achieved throughput every 5 seconds and a final summary
— see [Common mistakes](#common-mistakes): never claim a number you have
not measured.

**5. The streaming feature job starts automatically** with `docker compose
up -d` (it's a service in the same compose file, built from
`streaming/Dockerfile`), and will:

- Parse and validate `raw.transactions`, routing anything missing a
  required field to `dead.letter` instead of crashing.
- Compute 26 rolling behavioural features per customer and write them to
  Redis at `feat:{customerId}`, TTL-refreshed on every update.
- Run a second, independent query that prints a 5-minute/1-minute sliding
  window aggregate to its own logs — a direct demonstration of the
  watermarked sliding-window idiom, kept separate from the main feature
  pipeline (see [below](#the-streaming-feature-job-in-more-detail)).

Watch it work:

```bash
docker compose logs -f spark-feature-job   # batch progress, window-agg demo output
docker exec pulseguard-redis redis-cli HGETALL feat:C000001
```

**6. Run the tests** (all pure Python/pandas — no live Spark session,
Kafka, or Docker required to run them; `streaming/`'s tests only import
`pyspark.sql.types` for schema definitions, so `pip install pyspark` locally
to run them outside the container):

```bash
cd generator && python -m pytest tests/ -v
cd streaming && python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## The generator, in more detail

A fraud-detection project is only as good as its data — random noise
produces a model and a rule engine that learn / trigger on nothing
meaningful. Each synthetic customer is assigned one of five behavioural
archetypes:

| Archetype | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Salaried urban | 3–8 txns/day, 5–10 recurring merchants, one home city, salary credit on the 1st |
| Small business | 20–60 txns/day, wide merchant spread, high variance amounts, weekend activity |
| Student | 2–5 txns/day, low amounts, food and transport heavy, one city |
| Senior | <2 txns/day, very few merchants, mostly branch and ATM |
| Frequent traveller | Multi-city legitimately — geo-velocity rules must not flood on these |

Six fraud patterns are injected at a configurable rate (default ~0.3% of
volume), each a labelled burst of transactions: card testing, account
takeover, mule account, geo-impossible travel, merchant-category anomaly,
and salami slicing. `isFraud`/`fraudPattern` are populated on the wire
format but must never be included in a downstream feature vector — that's
label leakage, and the tell is a suspiciously perfect AUC.

## The streaming feature job, in more detail

**Two independent stateful mechanisms, deliberately.** The build plan's
watermarked-window code sample (`groupBy(customerId, window(...))`) is the
right tool for a straightforward rolling count/sum over a fixed window, but
several features here don't fit that model at all — a 30-day trailing
mean, "distinct devices in the last 7 days," or "is this merchant category
new for this customer, ever" don't have a single window length, and
Spark's window-aggregation state is sized for tracking many concurrent
windows, not one arbitrarily-long customer history. So the job runs both:
a `groupBy(customerId, window(...))` query as a direct demonstration of
the watermarked sliding-window idiom (visible in `docker compose logs`),
and, for the actual feature vector, a `applyInPandasWithState` operator
maintaining one compact state object per customer.

**One state object, not a dozen counters.** Each customer's state is a
bounded event-history buffer (pruned to 7 days, hard-capped at 3000 events
regardless of age — the answer to "your state store grows unboundedly, how
do you fix it") plus a few O(1) running stats (EMA mean/variance, running
max, a city-frequency map for modal-city, a device last-seen map, an
hour-of-day histogram). Every velocity and diversity feature is a cheap
filter over that one buffer, computed fresh per event, rather than a
separate incremental counter per window per feature. A
`ProcessingTimeTimeout` of 10 idle days drops a quiet customer's state
entirely.

**Trailing mean/std is an EMA, not an exact 30-day window** — an O(1)-state
approximation rather than maintaining a 30-day ring buffer per customer.
Worth saying out loud in an interview: it trades a little statistical
precision for constant memory per customer regardless of transaction
volume.

**Why the state is a JSON string, not native Spark types.**
`applyInPandasWithState`'s state must conform to a declared `StructType`;
mapping the state's sets/nested-dicts/lists onto
ArrayType/MapType/StructType field-by-field is possible but multiplies the
surface area for Arrow/Spark type-coercion bugs. Instead, the Spark-side
state schema is a single `StringType` field holding a JSON blob
(`state_codec.py`), and everything on the other side of that boundary is
plain Python already covered by `feature_state.py`'s unit tests —
including a round-trip test asserting that a checkpoint-restore produces
byte-identical downstream features to never restoring at all, which is the
property that actually matters for correctness after a crash.

**Training/serving skew, mechanically.** `feature_state.apply_event` takes
a plain dict state and a plain dict event, returns a plain dict of
features, and has no import of `pyspark` anywhere in it. The Structured
Streaming job calls it inside `applyInPandasWithState`; the Phase 3 batch
feature-backfill script (for building a training set from historical data)
will call the *same function*, in order, over each customer's historical
records. It's not "the same logic reimplemented for training" — it's the
same function, imported twice.

## Common mistakes

These are the traps this project is deliberately built to avoid — see the
build plan for the full list:

- **Random data** instead of behavioural profiles.
- **Label leakage** — `isFraud`/`fraudPattern` in the feature vector.
- **Reporting accuracy** at <1% fraud prevalence (meaningless — precision/recall/PR-AUC only).
- **Unbounded state** in the streaming job.
- **Claiming throughput/latency numbers that were never measured.**
